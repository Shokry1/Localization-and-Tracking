# Project Proposal

Perhaps the most important delivery since all your term work depends on it. You are required to submit a **quality-document** containing the following requirements.

## Proposal Document Requirements

1. The proposed problem statement and its motivation.
2. Current state of the art accuracy for the proposed problem.
3. A short survey of available techniques for the proposed problem.
4. A detailed description of the technique used from literature to build on. Also mention why you will use this particular technique.
5. The proposed updates to the basic technique. Also mention what benefit do you expect from this update and why you think it is a good idea to try it.
6. Write about how will you evaluate your results, what kind of evaluation metric you will use to compare your results, and what types of plots/graphs will be used to point out the comparison results.
7. A survey of available datasets for your course project problem.
8. A detailed description of the dataset to be used. Also mention why will you use this particular dataset.
9. Mention the available online resources/papers you will collect during the survey.
10. Each team member contribution. You should state only the contribution in the technical work, so writing the document for example shouldn't be included.

## Deliverables

1. A quality-document containing the requirements.

## Guidelines for choosing the problem

Those guidelines are not mandatory, however, they might help you avoiding struggles past students faced. I recommend reading [AUC Possible Projects 2021](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y2M0J81s_fdOIbiYLun5EtJ755Njui5OCis1koolKpo/edit?usp=sharing).

### 1. Resources

The following are great hubs to search for a paper with code.

* The Android Collector
* [Papers with Code SOTA](https://paperswithcode.com/sota)
* [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)

### 2. Code

I recommend you to find a basic paper and work on top of it.

### 3. Dataset

Make sure the dataset is not huge to avoid problems for downloading, preprocessing, loading on memory (RAM), and training time.

## FAQs

### 1. What happens next?

I will review your proposal and check that it meets each individual specified requirement and whether accept, accept with updates or reject it.

The proposal update phase will be used to update the proposal incase of rejection or updates request.

### 2. How this phase is graded?

* Each individual specified requirement has a grade.
* Clear amount of effort done.
* Overall proposal document quality.
* The readability of the proposal.

### 3. What is not acceptable in this phase?

The following are some examples of unacceptable work in proposals:

* Just copying one or two papers into the proposal and sort the proposal in a different order.
* Having sentences like "We achieved the state of the art results", which shows clearly that you didn't write this proposal specifically to me.
* Assume that the reader is aware of all the world terminology, sentences like "We will use Dead-reckoning to track the users" and I'm left to figure out what is Dead-reckoning.
* Some proposals don't state clearly the base technique, sentences like "we will use fingerprinting technique". How am I supposed to know what type of model you will use from the fingerprinting family?

You need to be precise, discrete, and organized.

### 4. Can I use the same problem proposed in selected proposals ?

Unless you provide a major update I will most probably reject your proposal.
